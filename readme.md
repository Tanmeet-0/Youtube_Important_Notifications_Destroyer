# Youtube Important Notifications Destroyer

A chrome browser extension that deletes the useless important notifications section in youtube notifications, then displays the important notifications with the other notifications in newest to oldest order.


If you still want to know what Youtube considers to be important notifications, choose to highlight
the important notification so they stand out more than other notifications.

Made using Typescript for the actual program, Webpack for the bundler and Node for Managing everything. 

Currently figuring out hoe to publish an extension on the chrome web store.
